# Software Optimization Final Exam Project - 2nd Topic: Design and test the 3DES encryption #
### Project Details
* Understanding, implementing, and testing the Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm, a widely recognized encryption method. 
* Using three independent keys; where each 3DES key is 8 odd-parity bytes, with 56 bits of key and 8 bits of error-detection
* Create a GUI, to encrypt and decrypt any file.
* Create a Test Case Scenarios, and test documentation and then test the DES using static testing and dynamic testing.

## Installation instructions (Local)
